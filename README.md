# Lidar Data Visualization in VR

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a platform for visualizing Lidar data collected from autonomous vehicles in Virtual Reality (VR). By translating real-world sensor data into an immersive VR environment, the user can interact and understand the spatial characteristics of the driving environment. This application can be useful for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts working on autonomous driving technologies.

## Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: Visualize Lidar data in real-time as it is collected from the vehicle.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Navigate and explore the 3D environment.
- **Playback Functionality**: Replay recorded Lidar data sessions.
- **Data Filtering & Analysis Tools**: Apply various filters and analytics to the Lidar data.
